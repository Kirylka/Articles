Dog
The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a
domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct
population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over
14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the
development of agriculture. The dog was the first species
to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that due to
their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to
a large number of domestic individuals and gained the
ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
inadequate for other canids.[4]
The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for
various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and
color. They perform many roles for humans, such as
hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police
and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding
disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely
adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine bond
has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on
human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best
friend".

Taxonomy
In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus
published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of
species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word
meaning "dog",[7] and under this genus, he listed the
domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He
classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the
next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2]
Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from
the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata in
Latin term), which is not found in any other canid.[8]
In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from
the grey wolf, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog

communities were more isolated from each other.[9] In the
third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in
2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed
under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies and
proposed two additional subspecies, which formed the
domestic dog clade: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in
1758, and dingo, named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft
included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as
another name (junior synonym) for the dingo. Wozencraft
referred to the mtDNA study as one of the guides
informing his decision.[3] Mammalogists have noted the
inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the
"domestic dog" clade[10] with some debating it.[11]

In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival
Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the
dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis
familiaris and therefore did not assess them for the IUCN
Red List of threatened species.[12]

Evolution
Domestication
The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a
domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel,
Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological
evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.[13] The
dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried
along with a man and a woman, all three having been
sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large,
thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine
distemper.[14] Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years
ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their
status as dogs or wolves remains debated[15] because
considerable morphological diversity existed among
wolves during the Late Pleistocene.[1]
This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to
be domesticated[16][17] in the time of hunter-gatherers,[18]
which predates agriculture.[1] DNA sequences show that
all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and
descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that
was distinct from any modern wolf lineage. Some studies
have posited that all living wolves are more closely related

The questions of when and where
dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and
archaeologists for decades.[16] Genetic studies suggest a
domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago,
in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the
high Arctic, or eastern Asia.[22] In 2021, a literature review
of the current evidence infers that the dog was
domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North
Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas
and westward across Eurasia,[13] with dogs likely
accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.[13]
Some studies have suggested that the extinct Japanese wolf
is closely related to the ancestor of domestic dogs.[23]

Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth, with around
450 globally recognized dog breeds.[22][24] In the Victorian
era, directed human selection developed the modern dog
breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.[17]
Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders
within the last 200 years.[17][22] Since then, dogs have
undergone rapid phenotypic change and have been

subjected to artificial selection by humans. The skull, body, and
limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic
diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores.
These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which
include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and
colour.[17] Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding,
hunting,[17] retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits
include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression.[17]
Present-day dogs are dispersed around the world.[22] An example
of this dispersal is the numerous modern breeds of European
lineage during the Victorian era.[18]

Anatomy and physiology
Size and skeleton
Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of
the largest breeds, the Great Dane, at 50 to 79 kg (110 to
174 lb) and 71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the
smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and
13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 7.9 in).[25][26] All healthy dogs,
regardless of their size and type, have an identical
skeletal structure with the exception of the number of
bones in the tail, although there is significant skeletal
variation between dogs of different types.[27][28] The
dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae
on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles,
consisting of epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles, to
connect to; the long ribs provide room for the heart and
lungs; and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton,
allowing for flexibility.[27][28][29]

A lateral view of a dog skeleton

Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's
skeleton larger in size for larger types such as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers;
dwarfism has been selectively used for some types where short legs are advantageous, such as
dachshunds and corgis.[28] Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally
short tails have as few as three.[27]
The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in
terms of skull shape between types.[28][30] The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic
type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and
broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.[28][30] The jaw contains around 42 teeth,
and it has evolved for the consumption of flesh. Dogs use their carnassial teeth to cut food into bite-sized
chunks, more especially meat.[31]

Senses

Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and magnetoreception. One study suggests that
dogs can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field.[32] Dogs prefer to defecate with their spines
aligned in a north-south position in calm magnetic field conditions.[33]
Dogs' vision is dichromatic; the dog's visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays. They have
difficulty differentiating between red and green. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12–
25°, depending on the breed. Dogs' eyes of different breeds can have different retina configurations. The
fovea centralis area of dogs' eyes, which is attached to a nerve fiber, is the most sensitive to photons.[34]
While the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, the dog brain is dominated by a large
olfactory cortex. Dogs have roughly forty times more smell-sensitive receptors than humans, ranging
from about 125 million to nearly 300 million in some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds.[35] This sense of
smell is the most prominent sense of the species; it detects chemical changes in the environment,
allowing dogs to pinpoint the location of mating partners, potential stressors, resources, etc.[36] Dogs also
have an acute sense of hearing up to 4 times greater than that of humans. They can pick up the slightest
sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft) compared to 90 m (300 ft) for humans.[37]
Dogs have specialized whiskers known as vibrissae, sensing organs present above the dog's eyes, below
their jaw, and on their muzzle. Vibrissae are more rigid, embedded much more deeply in the skin than
other hairs, and have a greater number of receptor cells at their base. They can detect air currents, subtle
vibrations, and objects in the dark. They provide an early warning system for objects that might strike the
face or eyes, and probably help direct food and objects towards the mouth.[38]

Coat
The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves)
originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with
the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or
underside.[39] Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with
impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals.[40] Some dog
breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat. The coats of certain breeds are often
groomed to a characteristic style, for example, the Yorkshire terrier's "show cut".[31]

Dewclaw
A dog's dewclaw is the five digits in its forelimb and hind legs. Dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached
by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin. Most dogs aren't
born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs. Dogs' dewclaws
consist of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges. Some publications thought that dewclaws in
wolves, who usually do not have dewclaws, were a sign of hybridization with dogs.[41][42]

Tail
A dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the vertebral column, which is made up of a string of 5 to 23
vertebrae enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles. One of the primary
functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state.[43] The tail also helps the dog maintain
balance by putting its weight on the opposite side of the dog's tilt, and it can also help the dog spread its

anal gland's scent through the tail's position and movement.[44] Dogs can have a violet gland (or
supracaudal gland) characterized by sebaceous glands on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds,
it may be vestigial or absent. The enlargement of the violet gland in the tail, which can create a bald spot
from hair loss, can be caused by Cushing's disease or an excess of sebum from androgens in the
sebaceous glands.[45]
A study suggests that dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli. "Stimuli
that could be expected to elicit approach tendencies seem to be associated with [a] higher amplitude of
tail-wagging movements to the right side".[46][47]
Dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called kennel tail, happy
tail, bleeding tail, or splitting tail.[48] In some hunting dogs, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid
injuries. Some dogs can be born without tails because of a DNA variant in the T gene, which can also
result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail.[49] Tail docking is opposed by many veterinary and animal
welfare organistions such as the American Veterinary Medical Association[50] and the British Veterinary
Association.[51] Evidence from veterinary practices and questionnaires showed that around 500 dogs
would need to have their tail docked to prevent one injury.[52]

Health
Many different disorders can affect dogs. Some are congenital and
others are acquired. Dogs can acquire upper respiratory tract
diseases including diseases that affect the nasal cavity, the larynx,
and the trachea; lower respiratory tract diseases which includes
pulmonary disease and acute respiratory diseases; heart diseases
which includes any cardiovascular inflammation or dysfunction of

disorders; gastrointestinal disease such as diarrhoea and gastric
dilatation volvulus; hepatic disease such as portosystemic shunts
and liver failure; pancreatic disease such as pancreatitis; renal disease; lower urinary tract disease such as
cystitis and urolithiasis; endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome,
hypoadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism; nervous system diseases such as seizures and spinal injury;
musculoskeletal disease such as arthritis and myopathies; dermatological disorders such as alopecia and
pyoderma; ophthalmological diseases such as conjunctivitis, glaucoma, entropion, and progressive retinal
atrophy; and neoplasia.[53]
Common dog parasites are lice, fleas, fly larvae, ticks, mites, cestodes, nematodes, and coccidia. Taenia is
a notable genus with 5 species in which dogs are the definitive host.[54] Additionally, dogs are a source of
zoonoses for humans. They are responsible for 99% of rabies cases worldwide;[55] however, in some
developed countries such as the UK, rabies is absent from dogs and is instead only transmitted by
bats.[56] Other common zoonoses are hydatid disease, leptospirosis, pasteurellosis, ringworm, and
toxocariasis.[56] Common infections in dogs include canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine
parvovirus, leptospirosis, canine influenza, and canine coronavirus. All of these conditions have vaccines
available.[56]

Dogs are the companion animal most frequently reported for exposure to toxins. Most poisonings are
accidental and over 80% of reports of exposure to the ASPCA animal poisoning hotline are due to oral
exposure. The most common substances people report exposure to are: pharmaceuticals, toxic foods, and
rodenticides.[57] Data from the Pet Poison Helpline shows that human drugs are the most frequent cause
of toxicosis death. The most common household products ingested are cleaning products. Most food
related poisonings involved theobromine poisoning (chocolate). Other common food poisonings include
xylitol, Vitis (grapes, raisins, etc.) and Allium (garlic, oninions, etc.). Pyrethrin insecticides were the most
common cause of pesticide poisoning. Metaldehyde a common pesticide for snails and slugs typically
causes severe outcomes when ingested by dogs.[58]
Neoplasia is the most common cause of death for dogs.[59][60][61] Other common causes of death are
heart and renal failure.[61] Their pathology is similar to that of humans, as is their response to treatment
and their outcomes. Genes found in humans to be responsible for disorders are investigated in dogs as
being the cause and vice versa.[22][62]

Lifespan
The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the median longevity (the age at which half
the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) is approximately 12.7 years.[63][64] Obesity
correlates negatively with longevity with one study finding obese dogs have a life expectancy
approximately a year and a half less than dogs with a healthy weight.[63]

Reproduction
In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to
one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed
until up to two years of age for some large breeds. This is the time
at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle,
characterized by their vulvas swelling and producing discharges,
usually lasting between 4 and 20 days.[65] They will experience
subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body
Two dogs tied after mating
prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will
become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation.
Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the
same litter.[5] Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation. After ejaculation, the dogs are
coitally tied for around 5–30 minutes because of the male's bulbus glandis swelling and the female's
constrictor vestibuli contracting; the male will continue ejaculating until they untie naturally due to
muscle relaxation.[66] 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after seven to
eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable.[67][68] Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after
fertilization,[5][69] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter
consists of about six puppies.[70]
Neutering
Neutering is the sterilization of animals via gonadectomy, which is an orchidectomy (castration) in dogs
and ovariohysterectomy (spay) in bitches. Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality,
especially in male dogs.[71] Spayed bitches are less likely to develop cancers affecting the mammary

glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[72] However, neutering increases the risk of urinary
incontinence in bitches,[73] prostate cancer in dogs,[74] and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate
ligament rupture, pyometra, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.[75]
Neutering is the most common surgical procedure in dogs less than a year old in the US and is seen as a
control method for overpopulation. Neutering often occurs as early as 6–14 weeks in shelters in the
US.[76] The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) advises that dogs not
intended for further breeding should be neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later
be euthanized.[77][78] However, the Society for Theriogenology and the American College of
Theriogenologists made a joint statement that opposes mandatory neutering; they said that the cause of
overpopulation in the US is cultural.[76]
Neutering is less common in most European countries, especially in Nordic countries—except for the
UK, where it is common. In Norway, neutering is illegal unless for the benefit of the animal's health (e.g.,
ovariohysterectomy in case of ovarian or uterine neoplasia). Some European countries have similar laws
to Norway, but their wording either explicitly allows for neutering for controlling reproduction or it is
allowed in practice or by contradiction through other laws. Italy and Portugal have passed recent laws
that promote it. Germany forbids early age neutering, but neutering is still allowed at the usual age. In
Romania, neutering is mandatory except for when a pedigree to select breeds can be shown.[76][79]
Inbreeding depression
A common breeding practice for pet dogs is to mate them between close relatives (e.g., between half- and
full-siblings).[80] Inbreeding depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous
deleterious recessive mutations.[81] Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of
different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.[82]
In a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany,
German Shepherd Dog, Leonberger, and West Highland White Terrier), it was found that inbreeding
decreases litter size and survival.[83] Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund litters found that as
the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies
increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.[84] In a study of Boxer litters, 22% of puppies died
before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection.
Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.[85]

Behavior
Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog
(individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli.[86] Dogs' minds have been shaped by millennia of
contact with humans. They have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and
are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.[87] Behavioral scientists thought that a set of social-cognitive
abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed by the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent
mammals, such as great apes, are parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.[88]
Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their
behaviors.[89][90] In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and
dogs.[91] These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate

selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to
affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight
response[90][92] (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing.[90] Dogs generally show reduced
fear and aggression compared with wolves, though some of these genes have been associated with
aggression in certain dog breeds.[93][90] Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include
genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at
the expense of problem-solving ability.[94] In a 2023 study of 58 dogs, some dogs classified as attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder-like showed lower serotonin and dopamine concentrations.[95] A similar
study claims that hyperactivity is more common in male and young dogs.[96] A dog can become
aggressive because of trauma or abuse, fear or anxiety, territorial protection, or protecting an item it
considers valuable.[97] Acute stress reactions from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seen in dogs can
evolve into chronic stress.[98] Police dogs with PTSD can often refuse to work.[99]
Dogs have a natural instinct called prey drive (the term is chiefly used to describe training dogs' habits)
which can be influenced by breeding. These instincts can drive dogs to consider objects or other animals
to be prey or drive possessive behavior. These traits have been enhanced in some breeds so that they may
be used to hunt and kill vermin or other pests.[100] Puppies or dogs sometimes bury food underground.
One study found that wolves outperformed dogs in finding food caches, likely due to a "difference in
motivation" between wolves and dogs.[101] Some puppies and dogs engage in coprophagy out of habit,
stress, for attention, or boredom; most of them will not do it later in life. A study hypothesizes that the
behavior was inherited from wolves, a behavior likely evolved to lessen the presence of intestinal
parasites in dens.[102]
Most dogs can swim. In a study of 412 dogs, around
36.5% of the dogs could not swim; the other 63.5%
were able to swim without a trainer in a swimming
pool.[103] A study of 55 dogs found a correlation
between swimming and 'improvement' of the hip
osteoarthritis joint.[104]

Nursing
The female dog may produce colostrum 1–7 days
before giving birth, lasting for around three
months.[105][106] Colostrum peak production was
around 3 weeks postpartum and increased with litter
size.[106] The dog can sometimes vomit and refuse
food during child contractions.[107] In the later stages
of the dog's pregnancy, nesting behaviour may
occur.[108] Puppies are born with a protective fetal
membrane that the mother usually removes shortly
after birth. Dogs can have the maternal instincts to
start grooming their puppies, consume their puppies'
feces, and protect their puppies, likely due to their
hormonal state.[109][110] While male-parent dogs can
show more disinterested behaviour toward their own

puppies,[111] most can play with the young pups as they would with other dogs or humans.[112] A female
dog may abandon or attack her puppies or her male partner dog if she is stressed or in pain.[113]

Intelligence
Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve
problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference. A study with Rico, a Border
Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things
by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items after four weeks of the initial exposure. A
study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented that he had learned the names and could associate
them by verbal command with over 1,000 words.[114]
One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are similar to those of horses,
chimpanzees, or cats.[115] One study of 18 household dogs found that the dogs could not distinguish food
bowls at specific locations without distinguishing cues; the study stated that this indicates a lack of spatial
memory.[116] A study stated that dogs have a visual sense for number. The dogs showed a ratio-dependent
activation both for numerical values from 1–3 to larger than four.[117]
Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception.[118] Another experimental study showed
evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating
that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined
humans.[119] Another study showed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task,
dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at humans, while socialized wolves do
not.[120]

Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans,
and translate the information that dogs are transmitting.[121] Communication behaviors of dogs include
eye gaze, facial expression,[122][123] vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and
limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Dogs mark their territories by
urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment.[124][125] Both sexes of dogs
may also urinate to communicate anxiety or frustration, submissiveness, or when in exciting or relaxing
situations.[126] Aroused dogs can be a result of the dogs' higher cortisol levels.[127] Between 3 and 8
weeks of age, dogs tend to focus on other dogs for social interaction, and between 5 and 12 weeks of age,
they shift their focus to people.[128] Belly exposure in dogs can be a defensive behavior that can lead to a
bite or to seek comfort.[129]
Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. With their acute
sense of hearing, dogs rely on the auditory aspect of communication for understanding and responding to
various cues, including the distinctive barking patterns that convey different messages. A study using

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that dogs respond to both vocal and nonvocal
voices using the brain's region towards the temporal pole, similar to that of humans' brains. Most dogs
also looked significantly longer at the face whose expression matched the valence of
vocalization.[130][131][132] A study of caudate responses shows that dogs tend to respond more positively
to social rewards than to food rewards.[133]

Ecology
Population
The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment.[134][135]
In 2013, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million[136] and 987 million.[137] About
20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries.[138] In the developing world, it is estimated that threequarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community
dogs.[139] Most of these dogs live as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study
showing that village dogs' most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or
respond aggressively (11%).[140]

Competitors
Feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong
association with humans.[134] Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs in areas
where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage when facing large dog groups.[141][142] In
some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when
attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.[143] Although the numbers of dogs
killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take
dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.[141]
Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a
preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter their size.[144] Siberian
tigers in the Amur River region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. Amur tigers will not tolerate
wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same
way.[145] Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in their range.[146]
Dogs as introduced predator mammals have affected the ecology of New Zealand, which lacked
indigenous land-based mammals before human settlement.[147] Dogs have made 11 vertebrate species
extinct and are identified as a 'potential threat' to at least 188 threatened species worldwide;[148] another
figure is that dogs have also been linked to the extinction of 156 animal species.[149] Dogs have been
documented to have killed a few birds of the endangered species, the kagu, in New Caledonia.[150]

Diet
Dogs are typically described as omnivores.[5][151][152] Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural
societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an
increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[4] Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in

their saliva and are classified as having a high-starch diet.[153]
However, more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs
can only produce bile acid with taurine, and they cannot
produce vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh.
Of the twenty-one amino acids common to all life forms
(including selenocysteine), dogs cannot synthesize ten:
arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.[154][155][156]
Like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance.
These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between
carnivores and omnivores.[157]

Range
As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog has
notable exceptions of presence in:

A golden retriever gnawing on a pig's foot
bone

The Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated
from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that
continent
The Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land
bridge to Myanmar
The Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, an already extinct different canid
species
Individual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs or where the dogs died
out after original settlement, notably the Mariana Islands,[158] Palau[159] and most of the
Caroline Islands with exceptions such as Fais Island and Nukuoro,[160] the Marshall
Islands,[161] the Gilbert Islands,[161] New Caledonia,[162] Vanuatu,[162][163] Tonga,[163]
Marquesas,[163] Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter
Island,[163] the Chatham Islands,[164] and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers,
who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships).[165]
Dogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs. Starting practice in December 1993, dogs were later
outlawed by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty international agreement
due to the possible risk of spreading infections.[166]
Dogs shall not be introduced onto land, ice shelves or sea ice.

Roles with humans
The domesticated dog apparently originated as a predator and scavenger.[167][168] Domestic dogs
inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been
pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and

communication may account for dogs' trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households
and social situations,[169] and probably also their co-existence with early human huntergatherers.[170][171]
Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police
and the military, companionship, and aiding disabled individuals. These roles in human society have
earned them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are
also a source of meat.[172][173]

Pets
The keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a
long history.[174] Pet-dog populations grew significantly after
World War II as suburbanization increased.[174] In the 1980s, there
have been changes in the pet dog's functions, such as the increased
role of dogs in the emotional support of their human
guardians.[175][176][177] Within the second half of the 20th century,
the first dogs' social status major shift has been
"commodification", allowing it to conform to social expectations
of personality and behavior.[177] The second has been the
broadening of the concepts of family and the home to include
dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[177]

companion

A vast range of commodity forms aim to transform a pet dog into
an ideal companion.[178] The list of goods and services available
for dogs, such as dog-training books, classes, and television programs, has increased.[179][178] The
majority of contemporary dog-owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some state that it
is an ambivalent relationship.[177] Some dog-trainers have promoted a dominance model of dog-human
relationships. However, the idea of the "alpha dog" trying to be dominant is based on a controversial
theory about wolf packs.[180][181] It has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is characteristic of
dog-human interactions.[182] Human family members have increased participation in activities in which
the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.[178]
According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National
Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet
dogs.[183] The source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67%
own just one dog, 25% own two dogs, and nearly 9% own more than two dogs. The data also shows an
equal number of male and female pet dogs; less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters.[184]

Workers
In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs such as collies and sheepdogs have been bred for
herding livestock; for hunting; for rodent control (such as terriers); as search and rescue dogs;[185] as
detection dogs (such as those trained to detect illicit drugs or chemical weapons);[186][187] as homeguard
dogs; as police dogs (sometimes nicknamed "K-9"); as welfare-purpose dogs; as dogs who assist

fishermen retrieve their nets; and as dogs that pull loads (such as sled dogs).[5] In 1957, the dog Laika
became one of the first animals to be launched into Earth orbit aboard the Soviets's Sputnik 2; Laika died
during the flight from overheating.[188][189]
Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility
assistance dogs, and psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities.[190][191] A study of 29
dogs found that 9 dogs owned by people with epilepsy were reported to exhibit attention-getting behavior
to their handler 30 seconds to 45 minutes prior to an impending seizure; there was no significant
correlation between the patients' demographics, health, or attitude towards their pets.[192]

Shows and sports
There are breed-conformation shows and dog sports (including racing, sledding, and agility competitions)
for dogs to participate in with their guardians. In dog shows, also referred to as "breed shows", a judge
familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their
established breed type as described in a breed standard.[193] Weight pulling, a dog sport involving pulling
weight, has been criticized for promoting doping and for its risk of injury.[194]

Dogs as food
Meat from dogs is consumed in some East Asian countries, including China,[172] Vietnam,[173]
Korea,[195] Indonesia,[196] and the Philippines;[197] such traditions date back to antiquity.[198] It is
estimated that 30 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. Han Chinese traditionally ate
dog meat.[199] China is the world's largest consumer of dogs, with an estimated 10 to 20 million dogs
killed every year for human consumption—a figure derived from extrapolating industry reports on meat
tonnage.[200] Switzerland, Polynesia, and pre-Columbian Mexico historically consumed dog
meat.[201][202][203] In some parts of Poland[204][205] and Central Asia,[206][207] dog fat is reportedly
believed to be beneficial for the lungs.[208]
Eating dog meat is a social taboo in most parts of the world; debates have ensued over banning the
consumption of dog meat.[209] Emperors of the Sui dynasty (581–618) in China attempted to outlaw dogmeat consumption, with the Tang dynasty (618–907) partially prohibiting dog meat consumption at
events.[210] Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and
dogs is Western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals'
meat.[211][212][213][214] In some countries, selling or slaughtering dogs for human consumption is
prohibited, though some still consume it in modern times.[215][216]
In Korea
The most popular Korean dog dish, bosintang, a spicy stew, aims to balance the body's heat during the
summer months. Some followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing
one's gi, or the body's 'vital energy'. Dogs are not as widely consumed as beef, pork, and chicken.[217]

The primary dog breed raised for meat in South Korea is the Nureongi, which is a breed that has not been
recognized by international bodies.[218] In 2018, the South Korean government passed a bill banning
restaurants that sell dog meat from doing so during that year's Winter Olympics.[219] On 9 January 2024,
the South Korean parliament passed a law banning the distribution and sale of dog meat; it is to take
effect in 2027.[220]

Health risks
In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 59,000 people died globally from rabies,
with 59.6% of the deaths in Asia and 36.4% in Africa. Rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most
significant vector.[221] Dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year.[222] Children in midto-late childhood are the largest group bitten by dogs, with a greater risk of injury to the head and neck.
They are more likely to need medical treatment and have the highest death-rate.[222] Sharp claws can
lacerate flesh, which can lead to serious infections.[223] In the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in
more than 86,000 falls each year.[224] It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated
in U.K. hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study concluded that dog-associated road accidents
involving injuries more commonly involve two-wheeled vehicles.[225]
Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. In the United States, about
10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S.
population is infected.[226] Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision.[227]
Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.[228][229]

Health benefits
The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's
companionship can enhance human physical and psychological
well-being.[230] Studies suggest that there are benefits to physical
health and psychological well-being, but they have been criticized
for being "poorly controlled".[231][232] One study states that "the
health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social
supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a
companion animal".[233] Earlier studies have shown that pet-dog
or -cat guardians make fewer hospital visits and are less likely to
be on medication for heart problems and sleeping difficulties than
non-guardians.[233] People with pet dogs took considerably more
physical exercise than those with cats or those without pets; these
effects are relatively long-term.[234] Pet guardianship has also
been associated with increased survival in cases of coronary artery
disease. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within
one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who do not
own dogs.[235] Studies have found a small to moderate correlation
between dog-ownership and increased adult physical-activity
levels.[236]
A 2005 paper states:[230]

Walking a dog

recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a
reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any
psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research
has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among
children who live with pets.
Health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets.
For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and
psychological indicators of anxiety[237] and are exposed to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which
can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases (according to the hygiene hypothesis). Other
benefits include dogs as social support.[238]
One study indicated that wheelchair-users experience more positive social interactions with strangers
when accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[239] In 2015, a study found that pet owners were
significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.[240] In one
study, new guardians reported a significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month
following pet acquisition, which was sustained through the 10-month study.[234]
Using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late-18th century, when animals were
introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.[241] Animal-assisted
intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase smiling and
laughing among people with Alzheimer's disease.[242] One study demonstrated that children with ADHD
and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed
increased attendance, knowledge, and skill-objectives and decreased antisocial and violent behavior
compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.[243]

Cultural importance
Artworks have depicted dogs as symbols of guidance, protection,
loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, alertness, and love.[244] In ancient
Mesopotamia, from the Old Babylonian period until the NeoBabylonian period, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina, the goddess
of healing and medicine,[245] and her worshippers frequently
dedicated small models of seated dogs to her.[245] In the NeoAssyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs served as emblems of
magical protection.[245] In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are
viewed as kind protectors.[246]

In mythology, dogs often appear as pets or as watchdogs.[246]
Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur
throughout Indo-European mythologies[247][248] and may originate from Proto-Indo-European
traditions.[247][248] In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed, dragon-tailed watchdog who guards
the gates of Hades.[246] Dogs also feature in association with the Greek goddess Hecate.[249] In Norse
mythology, a dog called Garmr guards Hel, a realm of the dead.[246] In Persian mythology, two four-eyed
dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge.[246] In Welsh mythology, Cŵn Annwn guards Annwn.[246] In Hindu

mythology, Yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs named Shyama and Sharvara, which each have
four eyes—they are said to watch over the gates of Naraka.[250] A black dog is considered to be the
vahana (vehicle) of Bhairava (an incarnation of Shiva).[251]
In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.[246] Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the
iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog, after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her
womb and became pregnant shortly after that.[252] As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin:
Domini canis) means "dog of the Lord" or "hound of the Lord".[252] In Christian folklore, a church grim
often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege.[253]
Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets, but requires Jews to feed dogs (and other
animals that they own) before themselves and to make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining
them.[254][255] The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing them as
unclean,[246] although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on "pre-Islamic Arab
mythology" and "a tradition [...] falsely attributed to the Prophet".[256] The Sunni Maliki school jurists
disagree with the idea that dogs are unclean.[257]
